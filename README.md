## **Why this project exists**

This project combines:

- **AI reasoning**: Scores and evaluates movies with a detailed rationale.
- **Data validation**: Checks your CSVs for duplicates and missing data.
- **Advanced analytics**: Correlation matrices, genre trends, sentiment analysis.
- **Personalized recommendations**: Tailored to your favorite genres and minimum score preferences.
